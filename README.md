# leaflet-challenge

Used the URL with earthquake information to find data
-Went to the link of earthquakes the past 7 days of GeoJSON data

-Used that data to plot onto a streetmap
-size and color is correlated to the magnitude of the earthquakes
-created a legend to correspond with the size and color of the circles
